What could be improved for this project?
1. I wish I could come up with more diverse structure such as having interfaces for shopping cart, inventory, and account transactions
2. Catering System CLI class is difficult to test using unit test.
3. Test are being written does not cover all aspects of functionality across classes



Overall the structure of the code has been divided into 5 main parts(class and class groups)
1. Abstract class named item for in order to create objects such as Beverages, Dessert etc.
2. Group of classes for object that extends item class
3. Menu has main purpose to group methods related to user interaction
4. Cafe class aims to group actions needed to cover backstage activities
5. CLI is where main method is that runs the application, run methods uses methods from cafe, menu and item class
